    default: replace .c, etc. with .s 

-o: place output in file 'file' 
    default if not used: 
        place executable in a.out, object file for source.suffix in source.o, assembler in source.s, precompiled header file in source.suffix.gch, 
        all preprocessed C source on standard output
