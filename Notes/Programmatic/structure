dynamic/static libraries

    engine: depends on certain libraries 
    link all files into single dll 
    then link dll into game 
    

    ::create static libraries
    ::create engine dll
    ::link game engine dll into game 


hot swapping: 
    OS functionality: file change notifications or simply poll regularly 
    can hook scripting languages/interpreter to in-game console, network socket, etc. for 
        runtime flexibility 
    can use dll or overlays, shared libraries

    :have clean interface for plugins, just use dynamic libraries that can be loaded and 
        unloaded : nearly all platforms support dynamic loading and unloading of libraries
            --> view had to be recreated, but application did not need to be shutdown

    also, check out Boost.Reflection and Boost.Extension
