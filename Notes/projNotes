What do we need:  github account /TheCherno : Hazel Engine 

Entry Point: game vs. client control; 
	Primitive Building blocks: 

Application Layer: 
	How are events handled? 

Window Layer: 
	Only exist on main platforms (windows, os, unix)
	-Input 
	-events
		Event Managers 
		Entity/Component System 
	-Renderer (Biggest/Most complicated system) 
		: Renderer is big stuff --> true (colored pixels are nice) 
	-Render API abstraction: 
		multiple rendering api (OPENGL--> simplest, cross platform, DirectX
	-Debugging Support 
		:Logging System 
	-Scripting language (python, lua, c#, etc.) 
	-Memory System (custom allocators, custom tracking) 
		:Performance, important to manage well 
	-Entity Component System (ECS) 
	-Physics Solutions
	-File I/O, VFS 
	-Build system, custom asset types (3D models, custom types/textures) 
		:Hot Swappable Assets (Draw item in photoshop, update realtime in engine)
