    Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) 
        -Defined by OMG Spec
        -Allows clients to invoke operations on distributed objects
        -without concern for location, programming language of remote service, os, platform (32 or 64 bit word size)
            or communications protocol (TPC/IP, IPX, FDDI, ATM) 
        -CORBA is a support framework of applications, libraries, and services  for 
            making distributed procedure calls 
        -Program on computer 'C' (CORBA) client calls a function computed and processed on 
        computer node 'S' (CORBA server) and passes to it function arguments 
        -The function/method passes arguments and returns values as with any other c/C++ call except
        it may be distributed across the network so protions of the program may be executed on a remote machine

        interface between client and server is defined by the CORBA IDL language

        remote function/method may start programs (fork/exec) on remote computer or 
            run 4remote sevices unquely available to the remote computer and then return data
        

-CORBA is effectively a communications protocol 
    IDL (CORBA lang) is compiled to desired language 
    code can then be linked? 


After advancements in the field, trackerless torrents were invented. This was an upgrade to the BitTorrent protocol that
 did not rely on centralized trackers for gathering metadata and finding peers but instead use new algorithms. 
 One such instance is Kademlia (Mainline DHT), a distributed hash table (DHT) which allows you to find peers through other peers. 
In effect, each user performs a trackerâ€™s duties.
